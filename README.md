This repository includes codes, results, manuscripts, and other stuff for a project on the use of Graph Netwrok Simulator (GNS) for simulation of the dymamics of partices in a box. The particles translate, rotate, and colloid with each other and the walls.

**Note:** parts of the codes in this repo has been burrowed from the repository https://github.com/geoelements/gns and heavily modified for our own problem. This work is inspired by the following prior works:
